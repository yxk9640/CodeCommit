#### Objective:
This folder is dedicated to log coding problems on a daily basis. 

#### Updates:
Every week, I will update the list of questions for the upcoming week. This will provide a structured approach and allow for better planning and preparation.

#### Why:
Aim is to practise common no brainer problems to build reflexes which help not lose time thinking unnecessary tasks.
