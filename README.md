# CodeCommit
CodeCommit is dedicated to log solutions, and notes documenting my progress. 
Creating a GitHub repository to track coding progress:

## Goals
- Code every day
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Learn new algorithms and data structures
- Explore different programming languages
- Prepare for technical interviews

## Structure
### Daily Coding Challenges
Each day's challenge is stored in its respective folder under `Daily-Coding-Challenges/`. Each folder contains:
- `challenge.md`: The description of the challenge
- Solutions in various languages, named accordingly (e.g., `solution.java`, `solution.py`, `solution.js`)
- `notes.md`: Any notes or observations from the day

### Daily Warm-Up Practices
Each day's warm-up practice is stored in `Daily-Warm-Up/`. Each folder contains:
